# RollingBeadView
RollingBead is an android library that can make bead (lens) moving effect in views like imageviews.

# Features
- <b>Bead movement</b> : The library provides enough methods to control movement of moving bead.
- <b>single bead</b> : Method to form and dissolve single bead has been provided.
- <b>Reduction in calculation</b> : Effort has been made to reduce large amount of calculations involved.
- <b>Unharmed image</b> : Care has been taken not to harm the original image provided
- <b>Async Calculations</b> : The library does all operations asynchronously to avoid blocking the UI thread.

# Usage
Currently the library supports two types of usage:

## static Bead:

<img src="/sample/colors.gif" align="left" height="450" width="350">
<br>

## moving bead:

<img src="/sample/hope.gif" align="left" width="400" height="450">
<br>
